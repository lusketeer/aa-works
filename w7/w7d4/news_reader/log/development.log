Take a look at Time Warner Cable, the nation\\u0026#8217;s second-largest cable company (behind Comcast, which is attempting to acquire it). For its residential customers, the average monthly cost of TV service is $76.08, just a dollar more than it was two years ago. But internet service prices are up 21% over the same period, to an average of $47.30 a month.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003ETime Warner Cable is hardly alone in this trend; it just happens to break out its revenue per customer to a more granular level than some of its competitors. The company reported \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/29/us-tim-wrn-cab-results-idUSKBN0L219Q20150129\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Efourth-quarter earnings\\u003C/a\\u003E today. It lost another 38,000 TV subscribers but added 168,000 internet customers.

For example, Google could incorporate this technology into its own forthcoming \\u003Ca href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/111118414189048552116/posts/9WBWP2E4GDu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Eself-driving cars\\u003C/a\\u003E.

With contextual swiping, drivers might move their seats forward when they meant to turn down the air-conditioning, or turn up the heat when they meant to turn off the fans.

On Wednesday\\u0026#8217;s call, Zuckerberg laid out his three-, five- and ten-year plans for the company. In the next few years, it\\u0026#8217;s essentially business as usual for Facebook—grow revenue in mature markets, and hopefully figure out how to make a useful search product for the exabytes of data it has.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EZuckerberg spent a lot of time, as he has done on previous earnings calls, talking about \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://internet.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Einternet.org\\u003C/a\\u003E, the Facebook-backed project to bring the internet to developing nations. Zuckerberg said he plans to \\u0026#8220;connect everyone to the internet\\u0026#8221; through internet.org over the next decade. Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/2860966-facebooks-fb-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-q4-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript?page=6\\u0026amp;p=qanda\\u0026amp;l=last\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Easked\\u003C/a\\u003E why Facebook has put so much effort into this project. Facebook CFO David Wehner said it was a \\u0026#8220;good business opportunity\\u0026#8221; for the company, but it\\u0026#8217;s more than that—it\\u0026#8217;s what Facebook needs to secure its long-term future. Facebook is reaching a saturation point in its mature markets, and will need to turn the hundreds of millions of users it has on feature phones into revenue generators. By helping to create more mature markets, Facebook can try to use the same advertising model it\\u0026#8217;s currently using in the US and Canada in new places.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EIt\\u0026#8217;s uncertain how much Facebook will be able to materially affect the communications infrastructure in developing nations to create more users. Zuckerberg said on the call that he is excited by internet.org\\u0026#8217;s progress, and that six million people in Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya, and Colombia have so far connected to the internet through the organization. That\\u0026#8217;s modest progress compared with the 150 million people who live in those countries alone, or the roughly 4.4 billion people worldwide who \\u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/10/02/353288711/why-4-4-billion-people-still-dont-have-internet-access\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\u003Edo not have access\\u003C/a\\u003E to the internet.

It\\u0026#8217;s a free weight loss retreat that includes medically supervised lab testing, cooking classes, and talks with nutritionists.

Research has found some evidence of cost savings from proactive\\u003Cstrong\\u003E \\u003C/strong\\u003Edisease management, but only after several years, and has found little long term gain from the sorts of wellness programs Mackey is touting.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp\\u003EOpening a clinic for customers faces potentially bigger hurdles. At his own company, Mackey can incentivize staff to participate in wellness programs or choose his clinic. That\\u0026#8217;ll be tougher in a competitive health care market where his company has no particular expertise.
